Baked covered for 45 minutes uncovered or 15.  I basted the squash   with the the butter/honey from the cavity  allowing it to get a golden color.  Lovely Squash recipe Thanks Cookgirl  \n",

Baked covered for 45 minutes uncovered or 15.  I basted the squash   with the the butter/honey from the cavity  allowing it to get a golden color.  Lovely Squash recipe Thanks Cookgirl  \n",

Get inventive with the sauce. Etc. I do have a few recommendations. 1. Brush the dough with oil before cooking. This will help avoid a “bready” flavor. 2. Make sure you spread the dough out. You should end up with a 12-14” pie! My first attempt with a ~10” pie resulted in a crust that was too thick. 3. You may want to cook the dough a few minutes longer for a classic crispy pizza dough. 4. As others noted, the amount of yeast you need is less than in the original recipe. I actually used one packet of yeast and it worked fine. Experiment! I’m going to try this recipe again and make a few tweaks. Thanks for posting this!</td>\n",

       "1068711  This is a simple and easy vegan pizza recipe. For those commenting on flavor, that’s where your creativity comes in! Add some herbs and spices to the dough. Get inventive with the sauce. Etc. I do have a few recommendations. 1. Brush the dough with oil before cooking. This will help avoid a “bready” flavor. 2. Make sure you spread the dough out. You should end up with a 12-14” pie! My first attempt with a ~10” pie resulted in a crust that was too thick. 3. You may want to cook the dough a few minutes longer for a classic crispy pizza dough. 4. As others noted, the amount of yeast you need is less than in the original recipe. I actually used one packet of yeast and it worked fine. Experiment! I’m going to try this recipe again and make a few tweaks. Thanks for posting this!  \n",

Mine turned out a bit like vodka sauce somehow. I saut&eacute;ed the veggies in the oil and butter using my instant pot, then added everything else before pressure cooking for a few minutes as someone else suggested. A bit extra on sugar and some honey for bitter adjustment, a splash of chardonnay, and I always go big on garlic, too. Thank you, this will be my new go-to for pizza sauce.  \n",

I bought the Grape Nuts and cranberries on purpose to make them but forgot to check how much corn syrup I had. I only had about 1/2 of what I needed so used honey to make up the difference. My bars were a little softer and stickier that what they probably should have been but they sure tasted good! Thanks Mirj!  \n",

It is a bit sweet, even the kids thought so, so next time I'll cut back on the honey some. I used butter instead of oil and it worked well. My favorite thing about this granola is the walnuts. They add a different flavor that I really enjoy. Thanks for sharing Mirj!  \n",
       "128      I used generic brand bran cereal because the fiber content was higher. I also used 1 1/4 cups unsweetened applesauce and only 1/4 oil to make them more WW friendly. Any time I sub applesauce for oil, I also cut back on the sugar. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. The results were very moist and delicious muffins! I especially love the cinnamon-sugar topping. It makes them seem more special than \"bran muffins\". LOL! I had no trouble getting the cinnamon sugar to stick without the butter. I got 32 regular-sized muffins. Thanks for sharing the recipe, and for taking such good care of all of us here on Zaar! Hugs!  \n",

I do a few tweaks according to my likes. I use orange juice rather than water or apple juice, extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp vanilla and whole wheat flour. Works for me. Occasionally I top it with brown sugar. Pat it in with your hand as it soaks in nicely and makes a great crust.  \n",
