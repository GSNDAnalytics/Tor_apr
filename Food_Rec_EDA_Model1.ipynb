       "486161  this is a delicious soup that i originally found on the better homes and gardens website, but i've seen it reprinted on a variety of other cooking and recipe sites.  i tried to research the background so i could accurately list its origin when posting this recipe.  but there doesn't seem to be any sort of consensus whether this soup is more accurately classified as a cajun or creole recipe. it seems to be one of those age-old questions that has no definite answer one way or the other, though most sites seem to agree that its roots are firmly planted in louisiana.  so, i'll leave it up to each individual to decide if this is cajun or creole.   \n",
